You can download the apk provided here. Only works on Android.

Use the "GOT.png" to create the prefab(camera on the image(please make the image slightly big) for a second or 2 and look around as it may spawn at a different location. 
Github won't let me upload the apk because it's bigger than 25MB. I have tried to compress it and upload it. I have attached demo videos either way.
I have uploaded apk in the drive, you can download it from here.
